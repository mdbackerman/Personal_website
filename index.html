                    My future academic goals include attending a doctoral graduate program to in order to participate in industry research and perhaps even teach. I am specifically interested in working in quantum information science and quantum computing. I would like to participate in a summer research program in order to apply my classroom and research experience to a dynamic research environment with peers who are equally committed to gaining hands-on experience in the quantum field, while also interacting with leading professors and researchers. The exposure to new topics, opportunities for mentoring, and larger-scale experimental setups will be invaluable as I prepare not only for graduate school, but for my final year of coursework and research at my undergraduate institution. In addition to my skills and experience, I will bring discipline, extreme attention to detail, and an ability to work through challenging situations.

                      Single-handedly built a CSLM (Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope) for NV-based measurements of TMDs and other 2D materials. Wrote original software to control the experiment written in Jupyter-Lab notebooks using the QCoDeS data-acquisition framework and transitioned to a self-written GUI-based interface using PyQt5. Additionally, gained fluency in Python, the NI-DAQmx API, and further experimental methods and techniques for AMO physics, research practices, and collaboration.

                    Small dielectric particles in the Rayleigh size regime have the potential to be trapped by properties of focused laser light.
                    This is the principle that governs optical tweezers and is what I explored this past summer as a student researcher in Professor
                    <a href='https://chadorzel.com/' target='blank' id='link'>Chad Orzel's</a> lab at Union College. Over the course of seven weeks,
                    I fabricated an optical tweezers setup from an empty optical bench
                    and successfully incorporated an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). I worked 60+ hour weeks to understand and construct the optical tweezer setup on my own,
                    meeting with my advisor once a day to go over my work and ask clarifying questions. I used classroom knowledge and applied it
                    to achieve outcomes, not all of which were successful. Trial and error taught me persistence and gave me the patience needed for
                    future research. An IR laser at 810\(n\)m was used along with a 40\(x\) objective. The results of this research were:
                    consistent trapping of 1.06 \(\mu\)m latex beads and an AOM that produced a second,
                    moveable beam within the objective and was able to pull beads into focus. While simultaneous trapping of two beads was
                    not demonstrated, this research yielded a <span class='poster'><a href='Poster.pdf'
                    target='blank' id='link'>poster</a></span> that I presented multiple times to various audiences throughout
                    summer and the fall term. My summer project on optical tweezers will allow me to pursue more advanced quantum science research built on this foundational tool during my senior thesis next year and I hope to complete additional research this summer.
