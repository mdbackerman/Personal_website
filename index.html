                    My future academic goals include attending a doctoral graduate program to in order to participate in industry research and perhaps even teach. I am specifically interested in working in quantum information science and quantum computing. I would like to participate in a summer research program in order to apply my classroom and research experience to a dynamic research environment with peers who are equally committed to gaining hands-on experience in the quantum field, while also interacting with leading professors and researchers. The exposure to new topics, opportunities for mentoring, and larger-scale experimental setups will be invaluable as I prepare not only for graduate school, but for my final year of coursework and research at my undergraduate institution. In addition to my skills and experience, I will bring discipline, extreme attention to detail, and an ability to work through challenging situations.

                    <span>
                    To further my exposure to foundational AMO lab research in the summer of 2022, I worked in a quantum optics subgroup lab of Prof. Mikhail Lukin at Harvard University which was studying long-lived excitons in TMDs. This work was especially interesting to me because of its potential for novel electronic states in atomic-level devices. I gained experience with a helium-based cytostatic apparatus, microwave electronics, waveguides, fiber-optic usage and alignment techniques, and an in-depth crash course in scientific programming including Unix CLIs, exposure to multi-threading, live-plotting of data, data handling, software design, and user input validation. Specifically, I built the base laser scanning confocal microscope that will be used for NV center-based measurements of electronic states in TMDs and other 2D material-based devices. This work aimed to re-build a platform suited for my subgroup’s work. I was tasked with writing a new software package and providing another means to carry out measurements/characterization efforts of TMD-based devices using NV centers. This work was extremely interesting to me because I was able to work on both the hardware and software. I wrote the original software package to control the CSLM I constructed, handling hardware control (galvo scanning), data acquisition, and image processing all in a user-friendly GUI written using PyQt5 and the NI-DAQmx Python API. My custom control software package featured live-plotting, automatic labeling, basic input validation, data array saving, and visually displayed scanning information and was modularly structured to add features as the device is upgraded and a Montana cryostat is integrated. I was also able to complete a certificate at the Harvard CNS and gain exposure to methods for photolithography that can be applied to my future research in working with nanoscale optoelectronic devices. This project has taught me how to produce meaningful results and motivated me to continue to expand my knowledge by taking a seminar on computational physics and quantum optics this academic year.

                    Small dielectric particles in the Rayleigh size regime have the potential to be trapped by properties of focused laser light. This is the principle that governs optical tweezers and is what I explored this past summer as a student researcher in Professor <a href = "https://chadorzel.com/" target = "blank" id = "link">Chad Orzel's</a> lab at Union College. Over the course of seven weeks, I fabricated an optical tweezers setup from an empty optical bench and successfully incorporated an acousto-optic modulator (AOM). I worked 60+ hour weeks to understand and construct the optical tweezer setup on my own, meeting with my advisor once a day to go over my work and ask clarifying questions. I used classroom knowledge and applied it to achieve outcomes, not all of which were successful. Trial and error taught me persistence and gave me the patience needed for future research. An IR laser at 810\(n\)m was used along with a 40\(x\) objective. The results of this research were: consistent trapping of 1.06 \(\mu\)m latex beads and an AOM that produced a second, moveable beam within the objective and was able to pull beads into focus. While simultaneous trapping of two beads was not demonstrated, this research yielded a <span class = "poster"><a href = "Poster.pdf" target = "blank" id = "link">poster</a></span> that I presented multiple times to various audiences throughout summer and the fall term. My summer project on optical tweezers will allow me to pursue more advanced quantum science research built on this foundational tool during my senior thesis next year and I hope to complete additional research this summer. Funding for this research opportunity was partially provided by an academic award from: <a href = "https://www.nyspacegrant.org/"" target='blank' id='link'>The NASA New York Space Grant Consortium.</a>

                  Senior Physics Thesis (Chad Orzel Lab)
                </h3>

                  <p>
                  This fall, I embarked on an ambitious thesis project that I designed and proposed: the fabrication of an advanced imaging tool for instructional demonstration and for future original student research by both the Physics and Biology Departments at my school. Under the supervision of Profs. Chad Orzel (Physics) & Chu-LaGraff (Biology), I am constructing a multi-laser excitation (450, 488, and 594 \(n\)m) CSLM of my own design with collection read-out (computer-aided via SPCM) and a camera for imaging. I am writing a custom Python GUI-based software package tailored for this application implementing: auto-sample alignment and multiple imaging methods (all coordinate planes, tiling, \(z\)-stacking, and 3D model reconstruction) for this setup. This is a novel undertaking since active PI-based Physics research at Union College is non-existent. Through my own initiative, I have quickly learned to navigate college procurement and vendor setup and made fast friends with the facilities personnel, electricians, and IT staff. I sourced all items and materials, created a budget, and secured approximately $35k in institutional funding. This multi-excitation CSLM will be suitable not only for in-vivo biological imaging purposes but will also give the Union College Physics Dept. a platform for students to conduct various AMO research projects previously unavailable to them.
